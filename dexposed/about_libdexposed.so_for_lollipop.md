libdexposed.so for Lollipop 
-----------
Due to ART's complexity, libdexposed.so for lollipop current now is only a trail version. **It's not stable**.

Faults
-----------------
* Some optimizations in the Ahead-of-Time-Compilation  make it hard to hook all methods. One example is that ART inlines "easy"/short methods into the caller, or places direct calls to the native entry point in the assembler code. Also, the code deduplication, may hooking one method could also hook other methods. It can't hook now.
* The target, For example, TARGET_CPU_SMP=true (needed for multicore processors) didn't support. Now it only support "quick, 32-bits, arm".
* Hooked methods are similar to proxy methods in many aspects. so we don't have to care about the stack layout ourself. A method is known to be "special" (i.e. a proxy or native method) didn't support.
* It didn't compatible with android5.1 which have changed a lot from lollipop.

Future
-----------
Up to now, we still work to solve these faults. We think there is still a hope to resolvedï¼Œalthough not easy.
