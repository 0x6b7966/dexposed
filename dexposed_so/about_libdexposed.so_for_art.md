libdexposed.so for Art 
-----------
Due to ART's complexity, libdexposed.so for art in Master branch has some critical defect, it may bring a lot of maintenance effort. After do some research into the art source code, and some open source library. I think there still has some change to do ArtMethod AOP hook. Please refer to the dev_art branch. I upload some prototype for hook ArtMethod. Current now it still is in beta, and didn't do a lot test.

**Don't use it in production environment.**

-----
In dev_art branch, we use c java to hook artmethod, and we can compile in Android Studio, didn't need AOSP code for compile the libdexposed.so any more. This may be more convenient. 


Hook Principle
-----
* The hook stub is still the entry_point_from_compiled_code_
* Like inline hook in secutiry world, we use arm code to hook this stub, let it redirect to the zone we mmap, then jump to my c code to do some argument box,  and call the hook method.
